Graph representation method: sparse symmetric adjacency matrix
Order of operations:
      1) Ensure that the function returns as fast as possible if we are given a special case (empty graph, start = goal, etc)
      2) Prune off repeated edges
      3) Generate new form of graph as a sparse adjacency matrix
      4) Loop until completion Dijkstra's algorithm, vectorizing as much as possible
      5) Find the path based on minimum distances found
